        <p>Welcome to Smart Supplement Tracker support. We're here to help you get the most out of the app.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">How does the app calculate supplement timing?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                The app uses current sports nutrition research to determine optimal timing for each supplement. For training days, timing is calculated relative to your workout time. For rest days, supplements are scheduled based on their specific absorption patterns and effectiveness windows.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Can I use the app without setting a workout schedule?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                Yes! The workout schedule is completely optional. If you skip it during onboarding, the app will suggest general timing for your supplements. You can add your schedule later in Settings whenever you're ready.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">How do I change my workout time for a specific day?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                On the main screen, tap "Add Workout" or "Edit Workout" to adjust your workout time for that specific day. This won't change your weekly schedule - it's just for that day. Perfect for when your routine changes.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Why aren't I receiving notifications?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                First, make sure you've enabled notifications in your device settings for the app. Then, go to Settings in the app and:
                <ul>
                    <li>Set your notification timing preference (at time, 15min before, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Select which supplements should send notifications</li>
                </ul>
                Notifications are scheduled based on your daily supplement timeline.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">How do I add or remove supplements?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                Go to Settings and tap "My Supplements". Select or deselect the supplements you want to track. Changes take effect immediately.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Where is my data stored?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                All your data is stored locally on your device. Nothing is sent to external servers. Your supplement choices, workout schedule, and tracking history remain completely private and under your control.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">How do I mark a supplement as taken?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                On the main timeline, tap on any supplement to mark it as taken. You'll be asked to confirm the time you took it. For "anytime" supplements, just tap the item in the list at the top.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Can I see my supplement history?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                Yes! Tap the History tab to view your supplement intake for the last 7 days. You can see what you took and when.

        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">How do I reset the app?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                Go to Settings and scroll to the bottom. Tap "Clear all data" to delete all your preferences, schedule, and history. This will restart the onboarding process.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Is this app a replacement for medical advice?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                No. This app provides educational information and timing recommendations based on general research. It does not replace professional medical advice. Always consult with a qualified healthcare provider before starting any supplement regimen.
